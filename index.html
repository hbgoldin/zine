    <p>If your seeing this website, it means you found one of
the scattered QR codes. It's now your job to hide this code for someone else to discover. Go ahead, put it wherever you
think is a good spot. In a library book. Inside a stranger's mailbox. Anywhere but, well, maybe your mom's sock drawer.
That kind of defeats the purpose.</p>

    <p>Want to confess your own secrets you wouldn't tell /your/ mom? Go ahead, type them out below. Don't worry, they aren't
    being saved anywhere. No really, inspect the code of this page. It literally isn't set up to save your input.
    Think of it like a confession booth; You get to spill your dirty laundry, the website listens, and you get to
    walk away feeling a little better (AND get to skip that Catholic Guilt<span style="font-family: Helvetica">&trade;</span>). </p>
